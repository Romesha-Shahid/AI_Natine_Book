# Key terms and definitions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.

- **Humanoid Robot**: A robot with its overall shape based on that of the human body.
- **Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence designed to operate and interact within physical environments, often embodied in robots.
- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source middleware suite for robot application development.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical process, product, or service.
- **Gazebo**: A 3D robotics simulator that accurately simulates rigid body dynamics.
- **Unity**: A cross-platform game engine often used for high-fidelity rendering in robotics simulations.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool built on NVIDIA Omniverse.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Pipelines**: AI systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic action generation.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence program that can recognize and generate text, translate languages, and perform other language-related tasks.
- **Whisper**: An automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI.
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: The process of training a robot policy in a simulated environment and deploying it effectively in the real world.
- **Domain Randomization**: A technique used to bridge the sim-to-real gap by training models in simulations with randomized parameters to improve their robustness to real-world variations.
- **Kinematics**: The study of motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without considering the causes of their motion.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: The mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters of a robot arm to achieve a desired position of the end-effector.
- **Embodied AI**: AI systems that exist in physical bodies, typically robots, and interact with the real world.
- **Jetson**: NVIDIA's platform for AI at the edge, featuring small, power-efficient modules with GPUs.
- **RTX Workstation**: A high-performance computer equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs, optimized for graphics and AI workloads.
